This is a library for RAiO RA8875 Display Driver.
This is a development version for SPARK core of the most current version
and since I really don't like the spark toolchain it may contain a lot of errors.
Created by Max MC Costa for .s.u.m.o.t.o.y., the author of the original RA8875 library.
Under development, please do not use for any products.
