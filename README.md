RA8875 library b11p9 [variation for Particle Spark]
====================================================

**Wiki added!** https://github.com/sumotoy/RA8875/wiki<br>
This is the last <b>'development'</b> version, last known <b>stable</b> version is here:<br>
https://github.com/sumotoy/RA8875/tree/0.70<br>
The development release normally contain bug fixes so it's almost safe to use but if you have problems you can switch back to the stable release (I try to keep as stable I can)<br>
Moved a lot of 'bla bla' in the wiki, readme cleaned.<br>
This is the same version https://github.com/sumotoy/RA8875/tree/0.79b11p8 but refractored for using within<br>
Particle Spark online IDE, however do NOT import since it's never tested (only compile) and has errors still around.

 

Current beta **tested only with**:
* EastRising RA8875 7"Inch (800x480) with FT chip capacitive<br>
 Particle Spark<br>
